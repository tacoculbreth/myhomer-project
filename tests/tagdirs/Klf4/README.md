Files:
- `Klf4_peaks_ver2.bed`: BED file for SEA
- `Klf4_peaks.bed`: Intermediate file from HOMER Peaks file to BED file
- `peaks.txt`: HOMER Peaks file

Note, `Klf4_peaks_ver2.bed` was used for each SEA analysis and `peaks.txt` was used for HOMER analysis. 
Youu can safely assume that HOMER Peaks file is already pre-processed.
